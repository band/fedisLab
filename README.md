# fedisLab
Federated information systems notes and resources.

This repository is a collection of notes, documents, and links to resources that explore and describe the notions associated with decentralized, yet federated, information and social systems.  

Primary aims include:  
1. using Obsidian as the client application to compose notes and collect resources;
2. establishing and linking to a sibling repository to house and document software developed as explorations and experiments in decentralized federation;
3. maintaining a journal of activity and current state of work.
